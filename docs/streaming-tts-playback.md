# Streaming TTS playback (mock-first)

This is the FIRST outbound-playback milestone on top of the Twilio Media Streams
WebSocket. When a streaming FINAL transcript produces an AI text turn (see
docs/streaming-stt.md), the reply is synthesized (MOCK by default) and streamed
back to Twilio over the SAME socket as `media` + `mark` events.

The default is a deterministic MOCK; a REAL Deepgram TTS provider is now opt-in
(`STREAMING_TTS_PROVIDER=deepgram`, see docs/deepgram-streaming-tts.md):
- mock: no real speech synthesis (emits `b"MOCK-TTS:" + text`),
- deepgram: real mu-law/8k audio over a TTS WebSocket (provider returns RAW bytes;
  this playback layer still owns chunking + base64 + the media/mark events),
- no real hangup control (emergency/transfer playback is documented below).

Barge-in IS now wired (mock-first): when the caller speaks during playback, the
server sends a Twilio `clear` and marks the playback interrupted. It is OFF by
default (`BARGE_IN_ENABLED=false`). See docs/barge-in.md.

The non-streaming Twilio Gather/SpeechResult flow, `/voice/simulate`, streaming
STT, and the AI-turn metadata are all unchanged. Streaming TTS is OFF by default.

## Components
- `StreamingTTSProvider` (interface): `synthesize(text, *, language, voice) -> bytes`.
  `MockStreamingTTSProvider` returns deterministic fake audio, no external calls.
- Twilio outbound builders (safe JSON, never carry raw bytes in logs/metadata):
  - `build_media_message(stream_sid, payload_b64)` -> `{"event":"media", ...}`
  - `build_mark_message(stream_sid, name)` -> `{"event":"mark", ...}`
  - `build_clear_message(stream_sid)` -> `{"event":"clear", ...}` (used by barge-in;
    see docs/barge-in.md)
  - `chunk_bytes(data, size)` -> split audio into `<= size` frames
- `TwilioPlaybackService.play(send, *, stream_sid, ai_text, language, turn_order)`:
  resolves the voice, caps text, synthesizes, chunks, base64-encodes each chunk
  ONCE, sends N `media` frames then one `mark`, and returns a SAFE playback
  summary. Never raises - a synth/send failure becomes a degraded summary so the
  WebSocket cannot crash.

## When it runs
On the media stream, only when ALL of these hold:
- `TWILIO_USE_MEDIA_STREAMS=true`
- `STREAMING_STT_ENABLED=true`
- `STREAMING_STT_AI_TURNS_ENABLED=true` and a CallSession is linked to the stream
- `STREAMING_TTS_ENABLED=true`

A FINAL transcript -> AI turn -> `play(...)` sends media + mark. Partials never
produce playback (they never produce a turn). Emergency / operator-transfer turns
carry the official SAFE reply text (103 message / operator message) as `ai_text`,
so playing `ai_text` voices the safe message - never unsafe medical advice. Real
hangup after an emergency message is NOT implemented here (the call stays on the
media stream until Twilio/stop); a `clear`/close strategy can follow later.

If `STREAMING_TTS_ENABLED=false` (default) behavior is exactly the A25 one: the
AI turn is persisted, no outbound media is sent.

## Outbound events (samples)
media frame (one per audio chunk; payload is base64 of the chunk):

    {"event": "media", "streamSid": "MZ-on", "media": {"payload": "TU9DSy1UVFM6..."}}

mark after the last chunk of a turn (Twilio echoes it back at playback time):

    {"event": "mark", "streamSid": "MZ-on", "mark": {"name": "MZ-on:turn:0"}}

## Metadata (per turn, under stream_metadata.streaming_stt.turns[i].playback)
Safe counts + the mark name ONLY - never raw audio, base64, or secrets:

    "playback": {
      "provider": "mock", "enabled": true, "voice": "uz-UZ-MadinaNeural",
      "chunks_sent": 10, "bytes_sent": 158, "mark_name": "MZ-on:turn:0",
      "truncated": false, "degraded": false, "error": null,
      "status": "playing", "mark_received": false, "clear_sent": false,
      "interrupted": false, "interruption_reason": null
    }

`degraded=true` with `error` in {empty_text, tts_error, send_error} marks a failed
playback; `truncated=true` means the reply text or chunk count hit its cap. The
`status`/`mark_received`/`clear_sent`/`interrupted`/`interruption_reason` lifecycle
fields are driven by barge-in + mark handling (docs/barge-in.md).

## Env flags
- `STREAMING_TTS_ENABLED` (default false) - enable outbound playback.
- `STREAMING_TTS_PROVIDER=mock|deepgram` - `mock` (default) or the real Deepgram
  TTS adapter (docs/deepgram-streaming-tts.md; opt-in, fails fast without
  `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`).
- `STREAMING_TTS_CHUNK_BYTES` (default 400) - audio bytes per media frame (pre-base64).
- `STREAMING_TTS_MAX_TEXT_CHARS` (default 2000) - cap reply chars synthesized per turn.
- `STREAMING_TTS_MAX_CHUNKS_PER_TURN` (default 200) - cap media frames per turn.
- `STREAMING_TTS_VOICE_UZ` / `STREAMING_TTS_VOICE_RU` - resolved by language.

## What is implemented vs not
Implemented: playback provider interface, mock provider, Twilio media/mark/clear
builders, chunking + once-per-chunk base64, TwilioPlaybackService with caps and
safe degraded handling, WebSocket wiring (final turn -> media + mark), per-turn
playback summary in stream metadata, full test coverage.

Also implemented (A27): barge-in (`clear` on caller speech) + incoming `mark`
handling - see docs/barge-in.md. (A28): playback-latency metrics -
docs/streaming-latency-metrics.md. (A30): a REAL Deepgram TTS provider emitting
mu-law/8k frames Twilio can play - docs/deepgram-streaming-tts.md.

NOT implemented: real VAD / endpointing, hangup after emergency, provider-side
barge-in, persistent (multi-turn) TTS connections, audio-quality tuning.

## Next steps toward a real-time voice pilot
1. Real VAD / provider endpointing as the barge-in signal (barge-in itself is
   wired in A27 - docs/barge-in.md).
2. Hangup/handoff strategy after an emergency or operator-transfer message.
3. Audio-quality metrics and a live voice eval on top of the text evals
   (the real Deepgram STT + TTS providers are now wired; see the pilot checklist
   in docs/deepgram-streaming-tts.md).
